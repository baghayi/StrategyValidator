Strategy Validator
==================

## What is this?


## Installation
First you need to download this module to either manually, using git or by composer.
It is recommended to use composer, but the choice is yours.

If your are using composer, it will download the module to vendor/ directory by default.
If you are downloading manually, or cloning it using git, then you need to place it under vendor/ directory as composer does.

Then you need to add 'StrategyValidator' to your config/application.config.php file under 'modules' key.

+For installing using composer you need to run this command in your project's root directory: 
    composer require "baghayi/strategy-validator:dev-master"

+ If you want to directly clone it using git then you need to run this command under vendor/ (or wherever your modules will be loaded from) directory:
    git clone https://github.com/baghayi/StrategyValidator

+ You can also download module in a zip file by clicking on 'Download ZIP' button or use this URL, then place it under vendor/ directory:
    https://github.com/baghayi/StrategyValidator/archive/master.zip

Now you are ready to go.
